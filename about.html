            <h2>What is Basketball?</h2>
            <p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, typically consisting of five players each, compete to
                score points by throwing a ball through the opposing team's hoop. It is one of the most popular sports
                in the world, enjoyed by millions of people of all ages.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h2>History of Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physical education instructor. It was
                initially designed as an indoor game to keep his students active during the winter months. The sport
                quickly gained popularity and spread to other parts of the world.</p>

            <h2>Rules of Basketball</h2>
            <p>Some basic rules of basketball include dribbling the ball while moving, passing the ball to teammates,
                and shooting the ball into the opponent's basket to score points. Players must also pl

            <h2>Basketball Positions</h2>
            <p>Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever ,they have evolved as part of basketball.
                During the early years of basketball's evolution ,two guards ,two forwards ,and one center were used .in
                more recent times specific positions evolved ,but the current trend ,advocated by many top coaches
                including Mike Krzyzewski ,is towards positionless basketball,where big players are free to shoot from
                outside and dribble if their skill allows it.</p>
            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p> The five players on each side fall into five playing positions. The tallest player is usually
                the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more
                agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the
                shooting guard and the point guard, who implement the coach's game plan by managing the
                execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning). Informally, players may play
                three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one</p>
